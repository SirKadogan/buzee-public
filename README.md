# Buzee

Buzee was the first mobile app I ever built and it is by far the <b>largest</b>. It had many features and the startup built around it was incubated and received many prizes.

Buzee was a "Waze for buses". The idea was that people could share their live location anonymously while riding a bus, thus letting other people know where the bus was and how long it would take to reach each bus stop along the line.

We built a community around it so people actually shared their location, rated services and could report several events that could cause delays, for example.

The project was cancelled after about two years of existence since we had trouble monetizing it and we were working full time.

> :exclamation: Since this app was built for commercial use, the repository is private. Ask me if you want to checkout the code.

### :fire: Features

- Live location sharing with other users
- Anonymous forum where people could talk during transit/get informed about situations
- Traffic reporting (flat tires, broken buses, heavy traffic...)
- Gamification and coupon rewards for being an active member of the community
- Onboarding to explain the app, since it was fairly extensive
- Up to date arrival times, with less than 5 minutes margin of error anywhere in the city

### :computer: Technologies used

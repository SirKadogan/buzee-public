# Buzee

Buzee was the first mobile app I ever built and it is by far the <b>largest</b>. It had many features and the startup built around it was incubated and received many prizes.

Buzee was a "Waze for buses". The idea was that people could share their live location anonymously while riding a bus, thus letting other people know where the bus was and how long it would take to reach each bus stop along the line.

We built a community around it so people actually shared their location, rated services and could report several events that could cause delays, for example.

The project was cancelled after about a year of existence since we had trouble monetizing it and we were working full time.

> :exclamation: Since this app was built for commercial use, the repository is private. Ask me if you want to checkout the code.

### :fire: Features

- Live location sharing with other users
- Anonymous forum where people could talk during transit/get informed about situations
- Traffic reporting (flat tires, broken buses, heavy traffic...)
- Gamification and coupon rewards for being an active member of the community
- Onboarding to explain the app, since it was fairly extensive
- Up to date arrival times, with less than 5 minutes margin of error anywhere in the city

### :computer: Technologies used
